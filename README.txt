I have customised this website to the point it is at now, and intend to continue building it out as I improve my html, css and js skills.

The site is currently hosted through Github pages. This will change eventually, though I will continue to make all source files available here.

Please send any feedback you may have to nreynol7@uwo.ca, until the feedback feature on the site has been built out.
